* Line drawn on top the higher points of the letters is called the ascent line
* Line drawn under the lower points of the letters is called the descent line
* The Tail is the tip of the character in the descender area

# Layout
Creating a synergy between font, photo and design elements

## Layout guidelines
* Make your designs breathe by adding enough white space. Add margin and padding.
* Add information in order of key importance and group information that belongs together
* Divide up important information, turn content into separate blocks to create order, line these up with grids and guides to create even spaces
* Create a balance between all elements, don't let them compete with each other
* Donâ€™t forget where the focal point should be in the composition 
* Prevent long headings, maybe use a subline instead
* Follow the general flow of the picture

## Small design details
* use textures to fill the void of large blocks of space
* use the burn tool to burn the edges to create a highlighted middle area
* play around with opacity and blending modes
* use textures on typography
